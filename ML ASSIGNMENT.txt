1. How does AI differ from traditional programming?
Traditional programming follows fixed rules written by humans, while AI learns patterns and makes decisions from data.

2. What are some real-world applications of AI?
AI is used in voice assistants, recommendation systems, medical diagnosis, self-driving cars, and face recognition.

3. Explain the difference between Narrow AI, General AI and Super AI.
Narrow AI performs specific tasks, General AI can perform any human-level task, and Super AI surpasses human intelligence.

4. Explain how Super AI could potentially surpass human intelligence.
Super AI can process massive data, improve itself continuously, and make faster and more accurate decisions than humans.

5. What ethical concerns are associated with Super AI?
Ethical issues include loss of human control, job displacement, misuse of power, and threats to human safety.

6. What is Reactive Machine AI? Give examples.
Reactive AI responds only to current input without memory; examples include IBM Deep Blue and basic game-playing AI.

7. Explain the concept of Theory of Mind AI.
Theory of Mind AI can understand emotions, beliefs, and intentions of humans to interact socially.

8. How does Limited Memory AI differ from Reactive AI?
Limited Memory AI learns from past data, while Reactive AI has no memory and reacts only to present situations.

9. How does Machine Learning relate to Artificial Intelligence?
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve automatically from data.

10. Give examples of Machine Learning applications in daily life.
Examples include email spam filters, YouTube recommendations, voice assistants, and online shopping suggestions.

11. What is the difference between training and testing data?
Training data is used to teach the model, while testing data is used to evaluate its performance.

12. Which learning method is best suited for labeled data?
Supervised learning is best suited for labeled data.

13. Compare Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.
Supervised learning uses labeled data, while unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data.

14. Explain the difference between classification and regression.
Classification predicts categories, while regression predicts continuous numerical values.

15. What is overfitting in supervised learning?
Overfitting occurs when a model learns training data too well and performs poorly on new data.

16. How does unsupervised learning differ from supervised learning?
Unsupervised learning finds patterns without labels, while supervised learning learns from labeled data.

17. What is dimensionality reduction?
Dimensionality reduction reduces the number of input features while preserving important information.

18. How does reinforcement learning differ from supervised learning?
Reinforcement learning learns through rewards and actions, while supervised learning learns from labeled examples.

19. Explain the concept of “reward” in RL.
A reward is feedback that tells the agent how good or bad an action was.

20. What are some challenges in unsupervised learning?
Challenges include lack of labels, difficulty in evaluation, and unclear interpretation of results.
